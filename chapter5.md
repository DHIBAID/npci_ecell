# What are the limitations of such a system?

Since the system runs on a blockchain, there are quite a few challenges that need to be overcome, which are listed below:

## Maintainers

1. **Scalability issues** - Handling a growing number of transactions is challenging, requiring continuous improvements to the system's capacity and performance. As the number of users and transactions increases, the system must be able to scale efficiently without compromising speed or security.

## Customers

1. **Transaction latency** - Delays in processing transactions can be frustrating for users, especially in time-sensitive situations. The time it takes to confirm transactions can vary, affecting the user experience.
2. **Irreversibility of errors** - Inability to reverse transactions once confirmed can lead to significant losses if mistakes are made. This lack of recourse can be a major concern for users who are not familiar with the technology.

## Sellers

1. **Lower profit margins** - Even though sales have increased, profitability has decreased because the costs related to blockchain transactions are reducing profit margins. These costs include transaction fees and the expenses of hiring specialized staff, which contribute to higher operational costs.

2. **Inventory management issues** - Challenges in maintaining optimal stock levels due to the complexities of integrating blockchain with existing inventory systems. Real-time tracking and updating of inventory can be difficult, leading to potential stockouts or overstock situations.
 can be frustrating for users, especially in time-sensitive situations. The time it takes to confirm transactions can vary, affecting the user experience.
