# Problem Statement

In todayâ€™s competitive market, businesses use reward systems as a key tool to retain customers and encourage repeat purchases. These systems usually allow customers to accumulate points based on their spending, which can later be redeemed for discounts, free products, or services. However, these reward points are typically confined to the shop, app, or brand that issued them, creating a siloed ecosystem. This approach limits the potential value of such systems for customers and creates inefficiencies in their utility.

From the perspective of the customer, this fragmentation is a major drawback. For example, a user might accumulate points on multiple apps or at various shops, but the points might remain underutilized due to insufficient balance on a single platform or limited redemption options.

### The Opportunity for a Unified Reward System (URS)

A Unified Reward System (URS) aims to address this issue by creating a shared loyalty network where customers can earn and redeem points across a variety of participating sellers. This would provide customers with a seamless and flexible experience while fostering collaboration among businesses. The URS also introduces opportunities for smaller sellers, who may lack the resources to implement standalone loyalty programs, to benefit from a shared platform.

**For customers:** It offers convenience, flexibility, and enhanced value for their loyalty.

**For sellers:** It enables access to a shared customer base, increased footfall, and reduced costs associated with running independent programs.

By fostering a collaborative ecosystem, the URS has the potential to transform the loyalty landscape, benefiting both consumers and businesses. The subsequent sections of this document will delve into the incentives for sellers, technical solutions, and the implementation roadmap for making this vision a reality.
