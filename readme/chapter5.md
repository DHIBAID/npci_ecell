# What are the limitations of such a system?
Since the system runs on a blockchain, there are quite a few challenges that need to be overcome, which are listed below:

## Maintainers
1. **Scalability issues** - Handling a growing number of transactions is challenging, requiring continuous improvements to the system's capacity and performance. As the number of users and transactions increases, the system must be able to scale efficiently without compromising speed or security.
2. **High energy consumption** - Maintaining the network requires significant power, leading to high operational costs and environmental concerns. The energy-intensive nature of blockchain operations, especially those using proof-of-work consensus mechanisms, can be a major drawback.
3. **Limited interoperability** - Integrating with other systems is difficult, often requiring custom solutions and extensive testing. This lack of standardization can hinder the seamless exchange of information between different blockchain networks and traditional systems.
4. **Storage requirements** - Blockchain needs large data storage, which can be costly and complex to manage over time. As the blockchain grows, the storage demands increase, necessitating robust and scalable storage solutions.
5. **Complexity of development** - Developing and maintaining the system is hard, necessitating specialized skills and ongoing training for developers. The complexity of blockchain technology requires developers to have a deep understanding of cryptographic principles and distributed systems.
6. **Forking and network upgrades** - Network changes cause disruptions, requiring careful planning and coordination to minimize impact on users. Forks can lead to temporary or permanent splits in the blockchain, creating challenges in maintaining a unified network.

## Customers
1. **Transaction latency** - Delays in processing transactions can be frustrating for users, especially in time-sensitive situations. The time it takes to confirm transactions can vary, affecting the user experience.
2. **Irreversibility of errors** - Inability to reverse transactions once confirmed can lead to significant losses if mistakes are made. This lack of recourse can be a major concern for users who are not familiar with the technology.
3. **Privacy concerns** - Risks of exposing user data due to the transparent nature of blockchain transactions. While blockchain offers pseudonymity, it does not guarantee complete privacy, and sensitive information could potentially be traced back to individuals.

## Sellers
1. **Increased operational costs** - Higher expenses due to increased sales volume and the need for more resources to handle transactions. Sellers may need to invest in additional infrastructure and security measures to support blockchain-based transactions.
2. **Lower profit margins** - Reduced profitability despite higher sales, as the costs associated with blockchain transactions can eat into profit margins. Transaction fees and the need for specialized staff can add to the operational costs.
3. **Inventory management issues** - Challenges in maintaining optimal stock levels due to the complexities of integrating blockchain with existing inventory systems. Real-time tracking and updating of inventory can be difficult, leading to potential stockouts or overstock situations.
